## 1. Spirulina Harvesting Process (NRSH)

### 1.1 Optimal Harvesting Parameters

Research indicates that Spirulina should be harvested when the following conditions are met:

| Parameter | Optimal Range | Ideal Target | Monitoring Method |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| Density | 0.8-1.2 g/L | 1.0 g/L | Optical density measurement |
| pH | 9.5-10.8 | 10.2 | Digital pH sensor |

Harvesting at these parameters ensures maximum biomass with optimal nutrient content and minimizes risk of contamination or culture decline.

### 1.2 IBC Tote Harvesting Process

The following step-by-step process is designed specifically for IBC totes, the standardized production units in the NRSH ecosystem:

#### 1.2.1 Pre-Harvest Preparation

1. **Equipment Sanitization**:
   - Clean all harvesting equipment with food-grade hydrogen peroxide (3%)
   - Rinse thoroughly with purified water
   - Air dry in a clean environment
   - Document sanitization process in the blockchain record

2. **Required Equipment**:
   - Food-grade collection vessel (minimum capacity: 50% of harvest volume)
   - 50-100 micron filter cloth (preferably nylon or polyester)
   - Harvesting pipe attachments for IBC outlet
   - Clean stirring rod (food-grade stainless steel)
   - Digital scale (accuracy to 10g)
   - pH testing equipment
   - Makeup mix components
   - Purified water source

3. **Culture Assessment**:
